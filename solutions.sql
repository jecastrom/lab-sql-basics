 Instructions:      
 
 Assume that any _id columns are incremental, meaning that higher ids always occur
 after lower ids. For example, a client with a higher client_id joined the bank after 
 a client with a lower client_id.
 
 Query 1
 Get the id values of the first 5 clients from district_id with a value equals to 1.
